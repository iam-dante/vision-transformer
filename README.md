# Vision Transfomer
A vision transformer, or ViT, is a deep learning architecture designed for computer vision tasks. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which rely on convolutional layers to process image data, ViTs utilize self-attention mechanisms commonly found in transformer models.
